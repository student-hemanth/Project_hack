Problem statement
Develop an interactive frontend component that allows users to create simple flowcharts by adding, connecting, and labeling shapes.

Implementation Requirements
Canvas & Shape Management: Provide a canvas area where users can add basic shapes (rectangles, circles, diamonds).
Enable dragging and repositioning of shapes.
Allow users to delete elements as needed.
Connections & Editing: Implement lines/arrows to connect shapes.
Ensure connections update dynamically when shapes are moved.
Allow text editing for both shapes and connectors.
Saving & Exporting: Provide an option to save/export the flowchart as JSON (for reloading) or as an image.

Evaluation Criteria
Interactivity: Shapes can be added, moved, and connected intuitively.
Editing Experience: Text editing should work smoothly.
Dynamic Updates: Connection lines should adjust properly when shapes are moved.
User Experience: The interface should be responsive, intuitive, and easy to use
